# Requirements for Information Retrieval System

## Dependencies for the Project
The following Python libraries are required:

```
nltk                 # Text processing: tokenization, stopword removal, case normalization
collections          # Default dictionaries for inverted index storage
json                 # Handling structured index data (inverted index, ranking parameters)
xml.etree.ElementTree # Parsing Cranfield dataset (XML format)
math                 # Mathematical computations for ranking models
pytrec_eval          # TREC evaluation metrics for retrieval effectiveness
```

## Installing Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Additional Requirements for Windows Users
If you are running this project on **Windows** and need to compile `trec_eval`, install **MSYS2**:

### **Installing MSYS2**
1. **Download and install MSYS2** from [https://www.msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org).
2. Open **MSYS2 UCRT64** terminal and run:
   ```bash
   pacman -S make gcc
   ```
   This installs `make` and `gcc` required to compile `trec_eval`.

3. Navigate to the `tec_eval` folder and compile `trec_eval`:
   ```bash
   cd tec_eval
   make
   ```

Now, you can run `trec_eval` on Windows just like in Linux.

## Notes
- **`nltk`**: Used for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization.
- **`pytrec_eval`**: Required for evaluating retrieval effectiveness using **trec_eval**.
- **`json`**: Handles structured storage for indexing and retrieval processes.
- **`math`**: Used in ranking model calculations, including BM25 and Jelinek-Mercer smoothing.
